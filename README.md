## Project Description

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data for the year 2017. By examining trip details, fare structures, and passenger preferences, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights that could enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and identify potential areas for fare optimization.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is the **NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data** for the year 2017. It includes detailed information about each taxi trip, such as:

- **Trip duration**
- **Distance traveled**
- **Pickup and drop-off locations**
- **Passenger count**
- **Fare amount**
- **Payment method**
- **Tip amount**

## Data Analysis Steps

The analysis is structured as follows:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., datetime).
- Explore the distribution of key variables such as fare amount, trip distance, and trip duration.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize the distribution of fare amounts, trip distances, and trip durations.
- Analyze the relationship between fare amount and trip distance/duration.
- Explore the impact of payment method on fare amount and tip amount.
- Identify peak hours and days for taxi usage.
- Analyze the distribution of passenger counts per trip.

### 3. Statistical Analysis

- Conduct hypothesis testing to compare fare amounts and tip amounts between different payment methods.
- Calculate correlation coefficients to understand relationships between variables.
- Perform regression analysis to model the relationship between fare amount and other factors.

### 4. Data Visualization

- Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and maps to illustrate findings and trends.

## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we will derive actionable insights and recommendations for the taxi industry, including:

- **Fare Optimization**: Identify opportunities to optimize fare structures, such as implementing dynamic pricing or tiered pricing based on factors like time of day, day of week, and trip distance.
- **Payment Method Analysis**: Analyze preferences and behaviors of passengers using different payment methods to identify potential improvements, such as reducing transaction fees or offering incentives.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Identify peak hours and popular routes to optimize fleet management and driver allocation.
- **Customer Experience**: Analyze customer feedback and satisfaction ratings to identify areas for improvement in service quality.

## Tools and Technologies

This project uses the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: For data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and statistical modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
