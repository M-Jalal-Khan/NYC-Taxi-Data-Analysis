Project Description:

This project aims to analyze the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data to gain insights into passenger behavior, fare structures, and payment methods. By understanding these patterns, we can identify potential areas for optimization and improvement in the taxi industry.

Data:

The dataset used for this analysis is the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data for the year 2017. This dataset contains information about each taxi trip, including:

Trip duration
Distance traveled
Pickup and drop-off locations
Passenger count
Fare amount
Payment method
Tip amount
Data Analysis:

The analysis will involve the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handle missing values and outliers.
Convert data types to appropriate formats (e.g., datetime).
Explore the distribution of key variables (e.g., fare amount, trip distance, trip duration).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of fare amounts, trip distances, and trip durations.
Analyze the relationship between fare amount and trip distance/duration.
Explore the impact of payment method on fare amount and tip amount.
Identify peak hours and days for taxi usage.
Analyze the distribution of passenger counts per trip.
Statistical Analysis:

Conduct hypothesis testing to compare fare amounts and tip amounts between different payment methods.
Calculate correlation coefficients to understand the relationship between variables.
Perform regression analysis to model the relationship between fare amount and other factors.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations to illustrate the findings, such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and maps.
Insights and Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, we will derive actionable insights and recommendations for the taxi industry, including:

Fare Optimization: Identify opportunities to optimize fare structures, such as implementing dynamic pricing or tiered pricing based on factors like time of day, day of week, and trip distance.
Payment Method Analysis: Analyze the preferences and behaviors of passengers using different payment methods to identify potential areas for improvement, such as reducing transaction fees or offering incentives.
Operational Efficiency: Identify peak hours and popular routes to optimize fleet management and driver allocation.
Customer Experience: Analyze customer feedback and satisfaction ratings to identify areas for improvement in service quality.
Tools and Technologies:

Python: For data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and statistical modeling. Â  
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
